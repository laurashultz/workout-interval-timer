## Functionality
* This web app was developed to satisfy a portion of the [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) Front End Libraries certification. 
* The test suite for this project appears as an overlay on the upper left-hand corner of the app, and it can be run by selecting '25+5 Clock' from the drop-down box, and clicking "run tests".
The primary function of this app is to run a session & break timer. Can be used for a workout session or something else that requires two different time intervals.

### Setting Session or Break Length
The session/break lengths can be incremented or decremented using the two associated arrow buttons. Both have a maximum length of 60 minutes and a minimum of 1 minute. The default session length is 25 minutes, and the default break length is 5 minutes.
Note: The session/break lengths can only be set when the corresponding timer(session timer or break timer) is not running. Both session and break can be set in the beginning, before the timer begins.

### Play/Pause
The play/pause button will do exactly as expected- it will play or pause the current timer.

### Reset button
The reset button will completely reset everything to default, and allow you to set both break and session lengths. 

## Web App Deployment
* If you would like to view the app itself, it's been deployed on GitHub pages! Please see [the deployed 25 + 5 Clock web app here](https://laurashultz.github.io/workout-interval-timer/).
* If you are interested in downloading the project and viewing it locally, you may clone the repo, navigate to the directory, and run the command `npm start` to view it in a local environment. If the command is run in the root directory of the repository, the app will be viewable by navigating to "localhost:3000" in your web browser.

## Future Updates
* Improve UI for appearance and accessibility


## Issues
* If you encounter any loss of functionality at any time while using the app, I would appreciate feedback!
